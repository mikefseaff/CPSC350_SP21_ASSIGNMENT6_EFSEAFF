Purpose:

This program has two BSTs, faculty and students, and acts as a data base system to add students or faculty memebers and check their data. A number of commands can be done like searching students and faculty by name, as well as rollback functionality incase any mistakes were made. Data is also saved to a binary file using object steralization.  

Compile:

make all

run:

./main.out

run time functionality:

the user is presented with a list of options to pick and can do any of the commands as long as they are valid and dont violate the error checking

output:

when the user decided to exit the program, both trees will be written to a binary file for saving the data
